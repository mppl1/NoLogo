An algorithm for predicting Crm1-dependent NESs

In order to successfully run the sample analysis (and for reproducibility purposes), you'll need the following separate files to run in the R-statisitical software environment, under the same directory.

1. run_nologo.R
2. read_fasta.R
3. hydrophobic_model35.txt
4. spacer_length35.txt
5. spacer_model35.txt
6. scNEStest.fasta
