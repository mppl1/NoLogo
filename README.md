An algorithm for predicting Crm1-dependent NESs

In order to successfully run the sample analysis (and for reproducibility purposes) need the following separate files in the same R

1. run_nologo.R
2. read_fasta.R
3. hydrophobic_model35.txt
4. spacer_length35.txt
5. spacer_model35.txt
6. sctestnes.fasta
